# hello-world
My very first repository

Hello there

I am JingQin. I am very curious and encouraged to take an adventure here. Nice to know you all. 

Experience:

1. Discovery phase: 
Low. I can formulate objectives.

2. Strategy phase: Medium.
I can solve the problem, doing research and analytics, but never have a chance to work on a real project.

3. Information Architecture phase: Medium.
I had worked on storyboards and rapid prototype/ wireframe in a homework based project.

4. Visual Design phase: High. 
I have solid art and design background in this field. I had been worked for over seven years in a high tech company as a multimedia designer. I also studied video and audio production/design in college.

5. Development phase: Low. I never have code experience before.

6. Launch phase: Low. 
This is a brand new field; I would like to learn more in Bloc.
